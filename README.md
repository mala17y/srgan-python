> WHAT IS SRGAN???

Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGANs) are a deep learning technique that uses a combination of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to create high-resolution images from low-resolution images.

Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGAN) is a deep learning application to generate high resolution (HR) images from low resolution (LR) image. In this work, we use SRGAN to up-scale 32x32 images to 128x128 pixels.

> VGGNET - 19 !!!!!

The VGG19 model, also known as VGGNet-19, has 19 layers, including 16 convolutional layers and 3 fully-connected layers. The model's input is a 224 × 224 RGB image with its mean RGB value subtracted.

The convolutional layers have a kernel size of 3 × 3 with 1 pixel of padding and stride

The VGG19 model is similar to the VGG16 model, but with three additional convolutional layers.
